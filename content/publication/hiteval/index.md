abstract: "Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming how people find information, and many users turn nowadays to chatbots to obtain answers to their questions. Despite the instant access to abundant information that LLMs offer, it is still important to promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Automatic hint generation is a new task that aims to support humans in answering questions by themselves by creating hints that guide users toward answers without directly revealing them. In this context, hint evaluation focuses on measuring the quality of hints, helping to improve the hint generation approaches. However, resources for hint research are currently spanning different formats and datasets, while the evaluation tools are missing or incompatible, making it hard for researchers to compare and test their models. To overcome these challenges, we introduce HintEval, a Python library that makes it easy to access diverse datasets and provides multiple approaches to generate and evaluate hints. HintEval aggregates the scattered resources into a single toolkit that supports a range of research goals and enables a clear, multi-faceted, and reliable evaluation. The proposed library also includes detailed online documentation, helping users quickly explore its features and get started. By reducing barriers to entry and encouraging consistent evaluation practices, HintEval offers a major step forward for facilitating hint generation and analysis research within the NLP/IR community."
