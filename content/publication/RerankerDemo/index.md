abstract: "Evaluating the quality of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and document reranking systems remains challenging due to the lack of scalable, user-centric, and multi-perspective evaluation tools. We introduce RankArena, a unified platform for comparing and analysing the performance of retrieval pipelines, rerankers, and RAG systems using structured human and LLM-based feedback as well as for collecting such feedback. RankArena supports multiple evaluation modes: direct reranking visualisation, blind pairwise comparisons with human or LLM voting, supervised manual document annotation, and end-to-end RAG answer quality assessment. It captures fine-grained relevance feedback through both pairwise preferences and full-list annotations, along with auxiliary metadata such as movement metrics, annotation time, and quality ratings. The platform also integrates LLM-as-a-judge evaluation, enabling comparison between model-generated rankings and human ground truth annotations. All interactions are stored as structured evaluation datasets that can be used to train rerankers, reward models, judgment agents, or retrieval strategy selectors."
